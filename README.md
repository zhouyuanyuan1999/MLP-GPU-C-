# Simple Fully Connected Neural Network using C++ CUDA

# Description
The network is coded from scatch without using any packages. To see how the network perform, see summary.pdf. 
The main file is in code/final/Src/fcn

# Download Dataset
Download MNIST dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. 
Put train-images.idx3-ubyte and train-labels.idx1-ubyte in code/final/training set.
Put t10k-images.idx3-ubyte and t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte in code/final/test set.
